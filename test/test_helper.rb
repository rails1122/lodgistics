# Warning: Some ultraghetto bullshit lies below.
#
# Poltergeist's instance of the webapp runs in a different thread than
# our tests, so they're using a different connection.  Something about
# the way FactoryGirl creates records (might just even be the amount of
# time it takes for the DB to commit the records) means that the thread
# running PolterGeist's instance of the app can't see the stuff we create
# with Factorygirl.
#
# This solution utilizes a single connection for all work done on models.
# I'm hoping that ActiveRecord handles the mutex around this connection
# internally, otherwise things will get weird.
#
# Perhaps an alternative would be to wrap FactoryGirl stuff (maybe
# monkeyatch ::create) so that transactions are commited before the
# method returns.  Perhaps ensuring synchronicity there would probably
# solve this problem as well.
